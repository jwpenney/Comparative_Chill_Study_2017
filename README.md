## Data Collection and Analysis

For the study discussed in this article, I used data collected via an online survey in March 2014. The dataset thus constituted 1,212 total survey responses. In the survey case study, survey data was statistically analysed using Goodman and Kruskal's gamma (γ) and Pearson’s chi-square (Χ2) test statistics.
